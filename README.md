# OBJECT-DETECTION
<h1> Purpose:</h1>
Object detection is breaking into a wide range of industries, with use cases ranging from personal security to productivity in the workplace. Object detection and recognition is applied in many areas of computer vision, including image retrieval, security, surveillance, automated vehicle systems and machine inspection. Significant challenges stay in the field of object recognition. The possibilities are endless when it comes to future use cases for object detection.<br>
Given the importance of object-detection in todayâ€™s world, the purpose of this project is to develop a robust object detection algorithm which helps in locating and identifying an object into different classes in an image.<br>
<h1>Technologies Used:</h1>
1) OpenCV<br>
OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.<br> 
2) Darknet<br>
Darknet is an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. It is fast, easy to install, and supports CPU and GPU computation.<br> 
3) Python<br>
Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
